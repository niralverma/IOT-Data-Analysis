## Day 1

The session started with Mr. Siddharth Bhatter(CEO of Karkhana India) explaining us about what Internet of Things (IOT) is. How important it is and its various uses, advantages and scope in the near future.
There was an interaction on the basics of IOT and upto what extent its potential is. 
Day 1 was just a small introduction on IOT and Data Analysis. 

## Day 2

Before the start of hands-on session, we were asked to download node.js and install node-red to access the dashboard.

*Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.*


Honestly, there were so many terms discussed. This session was from 10am to 2pm. We talked about hardware electronics like Arduino for sensors and requirements for IOT, how the data is sent via cloud to operate one device from another in distance. 
Some topics were briefly discussed like Internet, GSM, Bluetooth Internet (only in mobile), types of connectivities like RF, wifi, bluetooth, ethernet, etc; ISM band, ip addresses, IPv4, IPv6 and how we cannot access the internet without IP address.
